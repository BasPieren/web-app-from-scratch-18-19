## To Do üìå
This is a list of things I want to do in this course:

### Week 1
[Project link](https://baspieren.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/week1/)

- [X] Request data from the API with an asynchronous call.
- [X] Parse the data to JSON and save it in a temporary object.
- [X] Render data from the API on the overview page.
- [X] Use a `Promise` to request data from the API.
- [X] Use `fetch()` to request data from the API.

### Week 2
[Project link](https://baspieren.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/week2/)

- [X] Make an actor diagram.
- [X] Make an interaction diagram.
- [X] Use routing for the detail pages.
- [X] Use a templating engine.

### Week 3
[Project link](https://baspieren.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/week3/)

- [X] Make use of `localStorage`.
- [X] Split code into modules.
- [ ] .

## Description üìù
During this course I created a web app from scratch, so without any frameworks or libraries, using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data I use comes from the [Star Wars API](#api-). For now it only displays data from the API which is requested using `fetch()`.

## Installing üîç
To install this application enter the following into your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/BasPieren/web-app-from-scratch-18-19.git

cd web-app-from-scratch-18-19
```

### Packages and Technologies
This project makes use of the following packages and technologies:

  * [Transparency](https://github.com/leonidas/transparency)
  * [Routie](https://github.com/jgallen23/routie)

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
Here I explain some of the core concepts of this project using an actor and interaction diagram.

### Actor Diagram

![Actor Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/KOyR22a.jpg)
> An Actor diagram is focused on (code)objects that can be seen as the actors of your code.

### Interaction Diagram

> An interaction diagram focuses on functions and shows how user interaction flows through your application.

## API üêí
I made use of the following API for this project:

* [SWAPI](https://swapi.co)

The Star Wars API allows you to get data on different Star Wars subjects like the movies, characters and planets. You can use a couple of different endpoints to access this data:
```js
{
    "films": "https://swapi.co/api/films/",
    "people": "https://swapi.co/api/people/",
    "planets": "https://swapi.co/api/planets/",
    "species": "https://swapi.co/api/species/",
    "starships": "https://swapi.co/api/starships/",
    "vehicles": "https://swapi.co/api/vehicles/"
}
```
